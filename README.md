# web-starter-react
Minimal boilerplate for a modern SPA: ES6, Flow, React

## Technologies involved
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/): enable modern JavaScript
* [Flow](http://flowtype.org/): static type checking
* [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/): fast, scalable UIs
* [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader): automatic hot JS code reloading during development
* [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/): fast, auto-mocking testing framework
* [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme): shallow/scoped component testing for React
* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/): to bundle them all!

## Notes
Don't forget to:
1. Install some modern nodejs
2. Run `npm install`
3. Update and check `package.json` in order to look at available commands.
